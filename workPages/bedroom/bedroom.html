    <div class="textContainer">I am an experience. Perceived by others and myself as somewhat strange, sometimes a friendly one, sometimes not so much. I am the experience of my parents meeting by chance through a double blind date. I am all of the people I have met in life and conversed with. I am all of the places I have been, and all of the songs I have listened to. I am a brain, made of gray and white matter, sitting inside a skeleton controlling a nervous system to type this post out right now. I am the topics that I could scream about to the open sky, and I am the late nights spent whispering callouts into my microphone for my team in various inconsequential video games. I am constructed out of jokes, flimsy and fleeting. I am my maternal grandma’s doppelganger, coincidentally looking almost exactly like her and being named after her. I am the middle child, the bookworm. I am the thrill seeker of the family. I’ve leapt from heights where others would falter, and I’ve suffered the consequences of poor decisions. I’m a student, forever learning and seeking more information. I am a lover of all animals, seeking to understand feelings and find new experiences to further enrich my life and theirs. I am a friend, a sibling, an heir. I am American, born and raised in Arizona, though my ancestors hail from England and Northern Europe. I am a future hopeful medical student, hoping to heal others. I am like a prop plane, sometimes needing a push before I can fly on my own. I am the tens of thousands of hugs that I have given and received over my lifetime. These things aren’t just parts of my life, fragments of memories as they may seem, as they’re all parts of me. I am Andrea.</div>
